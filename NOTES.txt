Rough notes for building evilnose/roadrunner_manylinux:py38

For LLVM, build from llvm 6.0.1 source; installed to /home/llvm/install.
Got some errors 'undefined reference to 
`typeinfo for llvm::raw_ostream`' from 
linking roadrunner_c_api and sbml benchmark. Apparently this has to do
with LLVM not being built with RTTI enabled. I have no idea why RTTI is required
for manylinux but not other OS, but well. 

So, in the configure step for LLVM, add cmake variable "LLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=Yes".


For libroadrunner-deps, need to first do

```
yum install zlib-devel
yum install bzip2-devel
yum install libxml2-devel
```

For roadrunner, had to create symbolic link for numpy/include in the python include dir,
otherwise roadrunner build cannot find it.

See the .bashrc file in the evilnose/roadrunner_manylinux image for PATH info.
